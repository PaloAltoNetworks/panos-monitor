## Features âœ¨

* **Web-Based Dashboard:** A clean, centralized dashboard to view the latest status for all monitored firewalls, including their **hostname**, **model**, **PAN-OS version**, status, CPU/DP load, and aggregate throughput.
* **Capacity Dashboard:** Provides an at-a-glance view of current object usage (rules, routes, tunnels, etc.) against the device's maximum capacity, with color-coded utilization percentages to highlight potential issues.
* **Visual Alerting:** A dedicated "Alerts" page highlights any capacity metric that exceeds an 80% utilization threshold, with the ability to acknowledge and clear alerts.
* **Historical Graphing:** Click on any firewall to view detailed historical graphs for its key performance metrics.
* **Selectable Timeframes:** View graphs and summary data for various timeframes, from the last 5 minutes to the last 30 days.
* **Detailed Device Specifications:** Automatically polls and displays a comprehensive list of over 35 detailed capacity limits (max sessions, max rules, max tunnels, etc.) for each firewall.
* **Upgrade Advisor:** Analyzes peak usage against known model specifications and recommends a hardware upgrade if utilization exceeds an 80% threshold. The logic recommends the next model up within the same hardware generation, providing a practical upgrade path. If a device is already the top model in its series, it will recommend a general upgrade.
* **Peak Statistics Summary:** View a table of peak values (max sessions, highest throughput, max CPU/DP load) for each firewall over your selected timeframe.
* **Asynchronous Reporting & Downloads:**
    * A dedicated "Downloads" page for generating and downloading reports.
    * PDF reports are generated in the background, so the UI never freezes. The page auto-refreshes until your download is ready.
    * Export peak statistics to CSV, or generate PDF reports in multiple formats: Capacity, Table Only, Graphs Only, or a Combined report.
* **CPU & Dataplane Monitoring:** Tracks the load average for both the management plane (peak core) and data plane (average of all cores).
* **Intelligent Discovery & Polling:**
    * Automatically discovers and saves the **hostname**, **model**, and **PAN-OS version** for newly added firewalls.
    * Intelligently uses the correct API commands to get route counts based on whether a firewall has the advanced routing engine enabled.
    * Asynchronous background jobs for refreshing capacity and spec data, ensuring a responsive UI.
* **Panorama Integration:** Import all connected firewalls directly from your Panorama instance with a single click.
* **Dynamic Model Management:** Add, view, and delete firewall hardware specifications directly from the web interface, without editing any files.
* **Multi-Firewall Support:** Monitor dozens of firewalls. Firewalls can be added individually or bulk-imported from a text file.
* **Persistent Storage:** Uses a local SQLite database (`monitoring.db`) to store all configuration and historical statistics.
* **Web-Based Configuration:** Easily configure API credentials and the polling interval from a dedicated Settings page in the web UI.
* **Background Polling:** A multi-process background worker continuously polls devices without blocking the web interface.
* **Server-Side PDF Reporting:** Export multi-page PDF reports with summarized or raw data for various timeframes.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the PAN-OS Stats Monitor running.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have an administrator account on your devices with API access enabled.

* On your **firewalls**, navigate to **Device > Admin Roles**. Select a role, and in the **XML API** tab, ensure that **Report**, **Operational Requests**, and **Show** (under XML API) are checked. Assign this role to the user account you will use for polling.
* If using the Panorama import feature, the same API access must be enabled for your **Panorama** user account.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/panos-monitor
cd panos-monitor
```
### 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

* **Create the environment:**
    ```
    python3 -m venv pan-monitor-app
    ```

    * On macOS or Linux:    

        ```
        source pan-monitor-app/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:

        ```
        panos-monitor\Scripts\activate
        ```
### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. (Optional) Configure Default Firewalls

You can pre-populate the application with a default list of firewalls. This is useful for new deployments.
1. Open `app.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the `DEFAULT_FIREWALLS` list inside the `seed_initial_firewalls` function.
3. Add the IP addresses of your standard firewalls to this list.
### 6. (Optional) Add a Favicon

To add a custom icon to your browser tabs:
1. Create a `static` folder in your main project directory.
2. Place an icon file named `favicon.ico` inside the `static` folder.

## Usage Guide ðŸš€

### (Optional) Running as a Service on Ubuntu Linux

To ensure the application runs continuously in the background and starts automatically on boot, you can configure it as a `systemd` service. These instructions assume you have cloned the project into `/opt/pan-monitor-app`.

1.  **Create the service file:**
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pan-monitor.service
    ```

2.  **Paste the following content** into the file. Be sure to replace `your_user` and `your_group` with the actual user and group you want the service to run as (e.g., `ubuntu`, `www-data`).

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=PAN-OS Stats Monitor
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your_user
    Group=your_group
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/pan-monitor-app
    ExecStart=/opt/pan-monitor-app/pan-monitor-app/bin/python3 /opt/pan-monitor-app/app.py
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

3.  **Reload, Enable, and Start the Service:**
    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable pan-monitor.service
    sudo systemctl start pan-monitor.service
    ```

4.  **Check the Status:** You can check if the service is running correctly with:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status pan-monitor.service
    ```

5.  **View Logs:** To see the application's console output (including any errors), you can view the service logs:
    ```
    sudo journalctl -u pan-monitor.service -f
    ```

### 1. Run the Application

Launch the Flask web server by running `app.py`:
```
python3 app.py
```
On the first run, the application will automatically create a `monitoring.db` database file and a `secret.key` encryption key file in the project directory.

### 2. Initial Configuration

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** page using the link in the navigation bar. The application runs on port **4000**, so the URL will be `http://<your-server-ip>:4000`.
3.  Fill in the **Firewall Polling Settings**. These are the API credentials the poller will use to connect to individual firewalls.
4.  Fill in the **Panorama Import Settings**. These are the credentials for your Panorama instance, used only for importing devices.
5.  Set the **Polling Interval** and click **Save Settings**.

The background worker will automatically pick up these settings and begin polling.

### 3. Adding Firewalls

Navigate to the **Manage Firewalls** page. You have three options:
1.  **Import from Panorama:** Click the button to automatically discover and import all connected firewalls from your configured Panorama instance. Duplicates will be ignored.
2.  **Add Single Firewall:** Enter an IP address manually.
3.  **Import from File:** Upload a `.txt` file with one IP address per line.

### 4. Managing Firewall Models

Navigate to the **Manage Models** page. Here you can add new firewall models or delete existing ones. This data is used by the Upgrade Advisor. On first run, the application will automatically import a default list of models.

The background poller will automatically detect the model of newly added firewalls on its next cycle.

### 5. Viewing Data and Graphs

* The **Dashboard** shows the latest statistics for all devices.
* Click on any firewall's **IP address** to navigate to its detail page. Here you can view a summary table of peak statistics, see historical graphs, and use the timeframe selector to switch between views.

### 6. Using the Upgrade Advisor

* Navigate to the **Upgrade Advisor** page from the main menu.
* Select an analysis timeframe (e.g., Last 30 Days) and click 'Analyze'.
* The page will display a table showing the peak usage for each firewall compared to its model's capacity and provide a recommendation (e.g., 'Sized Appropriately' or 'Upgrade Recommended').

### 7. Exporting Data

* **CSV:** On any firewall's detail page, export the summary table to a CSV file by clicking the **'Export Table to CSV'** button.
* **PDF:** Navigate to the **Downloads** page. Here you can generate new reports (Capacity, Table Only, Graphs Only, Combined) across multiple timeframes. Reports are generated in the background and will appear in the "Available Reports" list when ready to download.

## How It Works

* **Front-End:** A **Flask** web application serves the HTML pages.
* **Back-End:** A **background thread** runs a continuous polling loop, which uses a **multiprocessing pool** to poll devices concurrently.
* **Data Storage:** A single-file **SQLite** database (`monitoring.db`) stores all application data.
* **Configuration:** Application settings, including encrypted API credentials and hardware specifications for the Upgrade Advisor, are stored in the database.
* **Security:** The password encryption key is stored in the `secret.key` file. **Important:** Do not delete this file, as it is required to decrypt the stored credentials. If you back up the database, back up this key file as well.
* **PDF Generation:** PDF reports are generated entirely on the server using **Matplotlib** to create chart images and **FPDF2** to assemble the document.
